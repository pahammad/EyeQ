# EyeQ

Images are a huge factor in web user experience. Human perception of image quality is known to be subjective and varies with factors such as devices and image contents. 
Even though image quality assessment (IQA) is a well-researched field, current state-of-the-art algorithms are not built for solving web image delivery problem because they do not consider device variations, image compression artifacts specific to web delivery pipeline, and certain types of images commonly seen on modern web such as text-overlay images. 
Most importantly, traditional IQA metrics are used to measure image similarity, while in the context of web image delivery, finding the right balance between perceptual quality and image file sizes is a more relevant problem. 
EyeQ is a crowd-sourcing web application aiming to collect data that would help study web image delivery problem. EyeQ works in Chrome, Firefox and Safari on both mobile and PC platforms. Use of various devices is encouraged.
